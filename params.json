{"name":"Omni","tagline":"Omni is a programming language","body":"# The Omni Project\r\n\r\n**THIS FILE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION**\r\n**THERE ARE NO WORKING DOWNLOADS, YET**\r\n\r\nFirst, let me tell you that Omni is not about creating something new. Omni does not invent new programming language features. It does not introduce new syntax or concepts.\r\n\r\nInstead, Omni changes the way programming languages work.\r\n\r\nAll programming languages consist of multiple steps to create an executable program or library. Every programming language's first step in creating a program or library is reading and understanding the source code that is stored in text files. Omni breaks with that concept. Code is no longer written in simple text files by (more or less) simple text editors. Instead, the code persists in a kind of database that stores the language constructs just as they are inserted by the programmer.\r\n\r\n## Advantages\r\n\r\n* No file clutter\r\n* No need for file naming conventions\r\n* No thoughts or arguments about which code belongs into which file\r\n* A whole project or set of projects is stored in a single file.\r\n* Inspect and edit the piece of code you are interested in, isolated from clutter around that code in the same file.\r\n* Jump/show declarations immediately, without the IDE to need to parse all code files to find the piece of code you want to jump to. Especially C++ programmers working on large projects know how bad this actually works, e.g. in Microsoft Visual Studio.\r\n* etc.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
